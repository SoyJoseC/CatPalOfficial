Given the high uncertainties, there is a need for combined epidemiological-macroeconomic scenarios. We present a model in this paper for developing such scenarios. The epidemiological sub-model is a discrete-time matrix implementation of an SEIR model. This approach avoids known problems with the more usual set of continuous-time differential equations. The post-Keynesian macroeconomic sub-model is a stylized representation of a closed economy with three sectors: core, social (most impacted by social distancing), and hospital, which may experience excessive demand. Where appropriate, the United States is used as a calibration reference. Simulations with the model show the clear superiority of a rigorous testing and contact tracing regime in which infected individuals, symptomatic or not, are isolated. Social distancing without social supports leads to an abrupt and deep depression. With a stimulus, the drop is slower and shallower. When testing and contracting tracing is introduced before the end of the stimulus, the drop is also temporary. Without a stimulus, the economy remains in recession or a depression due to excess capital stock and low consumer demand. Results suggest that social distancing and fiscal stimulus have had their desired effects of reducing the health and economic impacts of the disease."}, {"id": "130ba18f-ea9b-3474-be6c-d491e6a52a2b", "title": "THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND AGE-SPECIFIC POLICIES", "abstract": null}, {"id": "8e3f9a2d-93bd-36a1-b7eb-234673850701", "title": "\"Brazilian Modeling of COVID-19(BRAM-COD): a Bayesian Monte Carlo approach for COVID-19 spread in a limited data set context\" 1 ABSTRACT 1.1 Background", "abstract": "The new coronavirus respiratory syndrome disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major health problem worldwide. Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these mod-eling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. 1.2 Objectives: To predict Brazilian ICU beds demand over time and during COVID-19 pandemic \"peak\". 1.3 Methods In the present study, we describe a Bayesian COVID-19 model combined with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to forecast quantitative predictions of infections, number of deaths and the demand for critical care beds in the next month in the Brazilian context of scarce data availability.

Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets We have also created an inclusive unified database (<http://genoma.ma/covid-19/>) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest."}, {"id": "3dd05135-4ebc-3536-be32-64576a2aa918", "title": "Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: Systematic review and critical appraisal", "abstract": "AbstractObjective To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia. Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. With a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland.

We simulate multi-step and intermittent-with-feedback partial unlock of social distancing for rapidly-spreading moderate mortality epidemics and pandemics similar to COVID-19. Optimized scenarios reduce total cases and therefore deaths typically 8% and up to 30% by controlling overshoot as groups cross the herd immunity threshold, or lower thresholds to manage medical resources and provide economic relief. We analyze overshoot and provide guidance on how to damp it. However, we find overshoot damping , whether from expert planning or natural public self-isolation, increases the likelihood of transition to an endemic disease. An SIR model is used to evaluate scenarios that are intended to function over a wide variety of parameters. The end result is not a case trajectory prediction, but a prediction of which strategies produce near-optimal results over a wide range of epidemiological and social parameters.

Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases."}, {"id": "80e1d7f9-a0c8-3896-ab43-c9bf4425d190", "title": "COVID-19 in Latin America: Novel transmission dynamics for a global pandemic?", "abstract": null}, {"id": "ce98921a-6a73-3bca-ba0d-4144f83f3ee7", "title": "Spatial Modeling of COVID-19: Greece and Andalusia as Case Examples", "abstract": "We examine the spatial modeling of the outbreak of COVID-19 in two regions: the country of Greece and the autonomous community of Andalusia in Spain.

However, this test can take up to 2 d to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results and there is currently a shortage of RT\u2013PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiological findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose patients who are positive for COVID-19. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT\u2013PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT\u2013PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via RT\u2013PCR who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients."}, {"id": "6883062e-ebd2-3bf0-808b-742bcf479708", "title": "Evaluation of commercial and automated SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs using coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient samples.", "abstract": "Antibody-screening methods to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) need to be validated.

The RBP model addresses sample selection bias to estimate key determinants of virus infection given nonrandom testing. Applicable to anonymized case-level or widely available local-area data in the U.S., multiple data sources are shown. With suitable data the model can control for observed (e.g. population density) and unobserved factors to estimate the marginal effects of varying state-prescribed measures and behavioral social distancing. Case-level scoring models may, in addition, eventually assist in clinical diagnostic assessments. Although not proposed to substitute for more random population testing and other methods, results could also be used in advance of more testing. Uncertain assumptions in epidemiological models reflect unclear effects from gradations of social distancing now occurring. Despite many calls for broader testing and targeted quarantining in the U.S., many practical obstacles remain, leaving unknowns, especially across local areas. Differing local transmission rates respond to stronger or weaker social distancing and quarantining. High risks from latent non-quarantining spread warn of potential overwhelming local outbreaks. The insidious nature of SARS-Cov-2 invites complacency, especially in non-hotspot areas. Complacent behaviors can fail to adequately address the public-goods problem, leading to various forms of continued local and macro COVID-19 waves and crises. To assess a worst-case scenario, no model projection is needed, only the herd immunity threshold equation, estimates of the reproduction ratio, and the estimated mortality rate. With no ultimately successful countermeasures in treatment, vaccine, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the analysis here suggests an eventual number of deaths much like the 1918 pandemic in U.S. deaths per capita (1.8-2.7 million U.S. deaths) and in the total number of deaths worldwide (around 50 million). This toll also reflects a hypothetical global \"surrender\" strategy of business-as-usual and no social distancing, which in practice no nation has followed. Some successes across the three broad social countermeasure efforts-which appears most likely, in a mix of outcomes-can lessen the high social costs."}, {"id": "10bddbfb-bcdb-3415-8a99-9a1d8de99138", "title": "The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China", "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China.

We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan.

Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources."}, {"id": "080d6c94-df90-3376-8551-c9ab350f457f", "title": "SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment: a patent review", "abstract": "Introduction: Coronavirus has been responsible for several virus outbreaks since 2003, caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and currently SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), the causative agent of coronavirus disease in 2019.

This patent review aims to provide an overview of the patents that present possible treatments for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.Areas covered: To treat SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, researchers have filed patents for a number of therapeutic agents. Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons. In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced. Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments.Expert opinion: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections.

In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in the absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal, bronchial, and bronchiolar mucosae. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes.

Following initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with primary infection.

Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies."}, {"id": "d5ba69fe-d2f7-3ee9-a9ab-daf4b34d2ac8", "title": "Recent Insight into SARS-CoV2 Immunopathology and Rationale for Potential Treatment and Preventive Strategies in COVID-19.", "abstract": "As the outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is spreading globally, great effort is being made to understand the disease pathogenesis and host factors that predispose to disease progression in an attempt to find a window of opportunity for intervention.

The faculty were nine African experts from four countries and two French experts. The second session was held as pre-congress activities in Conakry, Guinea (Nov 20-22, 2016) and was completed in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon (April 18, 2017). The faculty were ten African experts, one French, one Swiss, and two British. In brief, sessions were organised into pathophysiology, genetics, epidemiology, clinical and therapeutics, scientific writing, and personal development and leadership. Each lecture included a 45-60 min presentation and 30-45 min of guided group discussion-mainly focused on local implementation and perspectives. Each day started with a report on the activities of the previous day, presented by a mentee who was chosen by the group. Between sessions, faculty members regularly interacted with trainees by posting homework on the D2A website. Trainees have been encouraged to network and design and submit research projects, and they will benefit from the expertise of D2A faculty. D2A will also provide funding for selected small research projects. The academy also encourages multicountry projects and plans to track and monitor the career of each D2A alumnus.
